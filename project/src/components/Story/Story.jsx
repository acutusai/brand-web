          For a 20-something year old boy out of work and looking for his next gig, this was like a dream company. 
          I mean… there is no competition in the market!! This is what I’d thought when the HR person told me about this company. 
          For the next few minutes, he went on to probe me about Market Research, Insights, and Data collection and I had no answers 
          except telling him that I am willing to learn. It’s been 17 years since that day, and I did learn what my HR actually meant 
          when he said we either partner with our competition or buy them. But along the way I am continuing to learn so much about 
          MR, Insights, and ResTech every day.
